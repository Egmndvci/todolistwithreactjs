## About Me
I am passionate about learning and this project reflects my initial exploration into web development and React programming. I look forward to expanding my skills further with more complex projects. am currently studying Computer Engineering, 3rd, at Fenerbahce University. I am a dedicated and motivated individual. Also, I'm interested in web development technologies such as Node.js, React.js, and Next.js. I also love to play video games in my spare time! Having a diverse background spanning across various fields, including concert organisation, aquatics coaching, and volunteer work through Erasmus+ programmes, I bring a unique blend of skills and experience. My time spent volunteering in France, Portugal, and Spain has not only improved my language skills but also my problem-solving, teamwork, and intercultural communication skills. I thrive in dynamic environments and am committed to continuous learning and professional growth. My passion for technology, combined with a strong foundation in both academic and extracurricular activities, allows me to succeed in the field of computer engineering.
